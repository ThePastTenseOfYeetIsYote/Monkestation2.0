  Absolucy:
  - bugfix: Fixed a runtime error (albeit a harmless one) relating to wooden barricades
      being deconstructed.
  - bugfix: Added a lot more sanity checking to liquid processing, which should make
      it much harder for liquid processing to completely break.
  Gboster-0:

      powergame

  - balance: Supermatter zap power generation scales with the delta time between its
      last zaps, preventing faster zapping from scaling power generation to extreme
      levels.
  - bugfix: Fixes supermatter zap rate not scaling properly. It should zap much faster
      at higher energy levels as intended.
  - qol: Changeling chemical generation scales with the world's delta time, making
      its rate independent of subsystem lag.

      it now too!
