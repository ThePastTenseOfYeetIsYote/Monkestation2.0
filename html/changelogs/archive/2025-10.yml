  - bugfix: Bug-suckers have had an insane amount of bugs squashed. I mean, seriously,
      these guys had a tracker dedicated to how buggy they were.
  - bugfix: Changing the pen angle is now on control click, instead of being on Z
      (conflicted with clicking the pen)
  - bugfix: Clicking a pen no longer makes it large, and instead keeps it tiny.

  - bugfix: Fixed being unable to click drag a crate off a cargo shelf if you didn't
      drag the shelf rather than the crate
