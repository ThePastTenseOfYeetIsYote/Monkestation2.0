  - bugfix: "Ethereal heart revive doesn't delete organs alien to your species, like prosthetics, cybernetics, and possibly itself."
  - bugfix: "Nightmare heart revive doesn't delete organs alien to your species, like itself, upon which it would stop the conversion to shadowperson."
  - bugfix: "Bloodsucker torpor, doesn't delete organs alien to your species, which would result in things such as wings being lost (therefore preventing ultrakill jokes from lasting more than 10 minutes)"
